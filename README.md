# InformationScraper
---

Given an email address, this program takes the domain portion and attempts to crawl the site, page by page, looking for other email addresses and phone numbers. It also performs a Places lookup using the Google API to attempt to gather various information if the domain is associated with a business, e.g. business address, opening hours etc.

Data is printed to the console and also saved in a directory for each given domain. Inside that directory, 2 files will be generated, one for the crawler service and one for the Google Places API. 

In order to make calls to the Google API, keys_blank.js needs to be renamed to keys.js and the string `"INSERT KEY HERE"` needs to be replaced with a valid Google API key that has been activated for google places. My keys.js has been .gitignored to prevent misuse.
